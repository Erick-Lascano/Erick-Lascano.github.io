This project contains my final project for **CS 65W: Data Analysis with Python** at **Stanford Continuing Studies**. The course provided a rigorous foundation in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using the modern Python ecosystem.

### Project Overview

The curriculum focused on how to analyze datasets. I utilized libraries such as Pandas for data aggregation and cleaning, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for statistical visualization.

### Key Technologies

* **Python:** Primary language for scripting and analysis.
* **Pandas:** extensive use of DataFrames for cleaning and reshaping data.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Creating static visualizations to identify trends and outliers.
* **Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive, reproducible research.

### Highlights

* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and inconsistent formatting in large datasets.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Applied statistical methods to summarize main characteristics of data sets.
* **Visualization:** Designed clear, publication-quality plots to communicate findings effectively.

This coursework strengthened my ability to translate raw data into structured knowledge, a skill I now apply in my advanced analytics roles.
