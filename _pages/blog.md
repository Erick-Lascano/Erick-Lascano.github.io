### Project Overview

This repository contains my coursework and projects for **CS 65W: Data Analysis with Python** at **Stanford Continuing Studies**. The course focused on data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using the Python ecosystem.

### Key Technologies
* **Python:** Core programming language.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and aggregation.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For static data visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive analysis.

### What I Learned
Throughout this course, I worked on processing real-world datasets, handling missing values, and deriving insights through statistical analysis and visualization techniques. This foundation is critical for my current work in Data Science and Fraud Detection.
