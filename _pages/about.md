Hi! I’m **Erick**, a senior undergraduate student in **Data Science and Mathematics Engineering** at [ITESM](https://tec.mx/en), expecting to graduate in June 2026. My research journey is driven by the convergence of rigorous mathematical mehtods and the predictive power of computing and data. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Mathematics**, with a specific focus on:

* **AI for Science:** Uncovering governing universal physical laws from data and discovering how AI can model complex dynamical systems.

* **Geometric & Topological Deep Learning:** Bridging pure mathematics and computation by applying Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and geometric principles to empower traditional multivariate statistical methods and capture structural invariants in data.

* **Mathematical Foundations of Learning:** Exploring the theoretical strenghts of Deep Learning and Machine Learning to develop models that are not only accurate but mathematically rigorous and interpretable.

* **Operations Research:** Applying stochastic processes** (e.g., Brownian Motion, Markov Chains) and metaheuristics to model volatility in financial markets and solve complex logistics and resource allocation challenges.

Currently, I am working as an **Advanced Analytics Intern at Crediclub**, where I engineer graph-based fraud detection pipelines through the use of interpretable ML models using Neo4j and PySpark. Previously, I collaborated on academia-industry projects applying TDA to fuel price volatility (SLB) and optimization algorithms for reforestation (CONAFOR).

My professional philosophy is guided by the responsibility and purposeful application of knowledge and science, best captured by a quote that motivates my work:

> "Those who have the privilege to know, have the duty to act."
> — **Albert Einstein** (As cited in HackHarvard 2025 by Prof. Pawan Sinha regarding Project Prakash)
