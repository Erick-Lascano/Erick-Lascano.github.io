Hi! I’m **Erick**, a senior undergraduate student in **Data Science and Mathematics Engineering** at [Tecnológico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en), expecting to graduate in 2026. My research journey is driven by the convergence of rigorous mathematical abstraction and the predictive power of modern computation.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Physics, and Mathematics**, with a specific focus on:

* **AI for Science:** I am interested in uncovering governing physical laws from data using methods like **Koopman Operator Theory (HAVOK)** and discovering how neural networks can model complex dynamical systems.
* **Geometric & Topological Deep Learning:** Applying concepts from pure mathematics—such as **Persistent Homology** and **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**—to capture structural invariants in data that standard embeddings miss.
* **Quantitative Modeling & Stochastic Processes:** Leveraging stochastic optimization and graph algorithms to model volatility in financial markets and detect anomalies in high-volume transaction pipelines.

Currently, I am working as an **Advanced Analytics Intern at Crediclub**, where I engineer graph-based fraud detection pipelines using Neo4j and PySpark. Previously, I collaborated on research projects applying TDA to fuel price volatility (SLB) and optimization algorithms for reforestation (CONAFOR).

My research philosophy is guided by the responsibility of knowledge, best captured by a quote that motivates my work in **AI for Social Good**:

> "Those who have the privilege to know, have the duty to act."
> — **Albert Einstein** (As cited by Prof. Pawan Sinha regarding Project Prakash)

I am driven to ensure my contributions—whether in uncovering the geometry of intelligence or optimizing critical systems—are truly purposeful and scientifically rigorous.
